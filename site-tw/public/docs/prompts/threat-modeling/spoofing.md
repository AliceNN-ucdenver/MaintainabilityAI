# STRIDE: Spoofing Identity ‚Äî Threat Modeling Prompt Pack

> **Spoofing** is pretending to be someone or something else to gain unauthorized access. This STRIDE category focuses on authentication failures where attackers impersonate legitimate users, systems, or services.

---

## üéØ What is Spoofing?

**Definition**: An attacker claims to be a user, system, or service they are not. Spoofing threatens **authentication** ‚Äî the process of proving identity before granting access to resources.

**Common Spoofing Attack Vectors**:
- **Credential Theft**: Phishing, keylogging, credential stuffing against weak passwords
- **Session Hijacking**: Stealing or predicting session tokens to bypass login
- **Token Replay**: Reusing captured JWT or API tokens
- **Weak Secrets**: Guessing or brute-forcing predictable authentication tokens
- **Man-in-the-Middle**: Intercepting credentials during transmission

**Why It Matters**: Successful spoofing attacks lead to complete account takeover, unauthorized access to sensitive data, and privilege escalation. Authentication is the first line of defense ‚Äî if it fails, all other security controls become irrelevant.

## ü§ñ AI Prompt: Identify Spoofing Threats in Architecture

<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1e293b 0%, #0f172a 100%); border-radius: 12px; padding: 24px; margin: 24px 0; border-left: 4px solid #10b981;">

**üìã Copy this prompt and paste it into ChatGPT, Claude, or GitHub Copilot Chat:**

```
Role: You are a security architect specializing in authentication and identity management. Your task is to perform STRIDE threat modeling focusing on Spoofing (S) threats.

Context:
I have the following architecture:

[PASTE YOUR ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM OR DESCRIPTION HERE]

Example:
- React SPA frontend (public internet)
- Node.js REST API (JWT authentication)
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis session store
- Auth0 for OAuth/SSO
- Microservices communicate via API keys
- Mobile app with biometric authentication
- Admin portal with separate login

Task:
Analyze this architecture for Spoofing threats. For each component, trust boundary, and data flow, identify where an attacker could impersonate a legitimate identity.

Format:
For each threat, provide:

**Threat**: [One-line description]
**Component**: [Which part of the system is vulnerable]
**Attack Scenario**: [Step-by-step attack walkthrough]
**Impact**: [What happens if successful ‚Äî data breach, privilege escalation, etc.]
**Likelihood**: [High/Medium/Low based on common attacker capabilities]
**Mitigation**: [Specific controls to prevent or detect this attack]
**OWASP Mapping**: [A07, A02, etc.]
**Code Example**: [Show vulnerable pattern and secure fix]

Focus Areas:
Pay special attention to:
- Login and authentication endpoints (password, OAuth, SSO)
- Session management (cookies, JWTs, server-side sessions)
- API authentication (API keys, bearer tokens, OAuth scopes)
- Service-to-service authentication (microservice trust boundaries)
- Password reset and account recovery flows
- "Remember me" and persistent login mechanisms
- Multi-factor authentication bypass scenarios
- Token refresh and rotation logic

Output:
Provide 3-5 high-priority spoofing threats with complete details. Prioritize threats that are both likely and high-impact.

## üìã Example AI Output

### Threat 1: JWT Token Forgery via Weak Signing Secret

**Threat**: Attacker discovers JWT signing secret and forges valid tokens for any user

**Component**: API authentication middleware (`/api/auth/verify`)

**Attack Scenario**:
1. Developer hardcodes JWT secret `"supersecret123"` in client-side React code
2. Attacker inspects browser JavaScript bundle and finds secret
3. Attacker uses jwt.io to generate new token with `{"userId": 1, "role": "admin"}`
4. Attacker signs token with discovered secret
5. API validates signature successfully and grants admin access

**Impact**: Complete authentication bypass. Attacker can impersonate any user including administrators, access all data, and perform privileged operations.

**Likelihood**: High (secrets in client code are trivially discoverable)

**Mitigation**:
```typescript
// BAD: Hardcoded secret
const SECRET = "supersecret123";
const token = jwt.sign(payload, SECRET);

// GOOD: Environment variable + strong secret
const SECRET = process.env.JWT_SECRET; // 256-bit random value
if (!SECRET || SECRET.length < 32) {
  throw new Error("JWT_SECRET must be 32+ characters");
}
const token = jwt.sign(payload, SECRET, {
  algorithm: "HS256",
  expiresIn: "15m" // Short-lived tokens
});
```

Additional controls:
- Rotate secrets quarterly
- Consider asymmetric signing (RS256) for public key distribution
- Implement token revocation list for compromised tokens
- Monitor for tokens with impossible claims (e.g., userId that doesn't exist)

**OWASP Mapping**: A07 - Authentication Failures, A02 - Cryptographic Failures

### Threat 2: Session Hijacking via Insecure Cookie Configuration

**Threat**: Attacker intercepts session cookie and impersonates victim user

**Component**: Browser-to-API session management

**Attack Scenario**:
1. User logs in from coffee shop WiFi
2. API sets session cookie without `Secure` or `HttpOnly` flags
3. Attacker on same network runs Wireshark, captures cookie in plaintext
4. Attacker injects cookie into their own browser
5. API accepts cookie and grants access as victim

**Impact**: Account takeover for any user on insecure networks. Attacker can read messages, change settings, make purchases.

**Likelihood**: Medium (requires network access, but public WiFi is common)

**Mitigation**:
```typescript
// BAD: Insecure cookie
res.cookie("sessionId", sessionId, {
  maxAge: 86400000 // 24 hours, no security flags
});

// GOOD: Secure cookie configuration
res.cookie("sessionId", sessionId, {
  httpOnly: true,        // Prevent XSS access
  secure: true,          // HTTPS only
  sameSite: "strict",    // CSRF protection
  maxAge: 3600000,       // 1 hour
  domain: ".example.com" // Explicit domain binding
});
```

Additional controls:
- Regenerate session ID after login (prevent fixation)
- Bind session to IP address + User-Agent (detect session transfer)
- Log concurrent sessions and alert user
- Implement absolute timeout (max 8 hours) regardless of activity

**OWASP Mapping**: A07 - Authentication Failures

### Threat 3: Password Reset Token Prediction

**Threat**: Attacker guesses password reset tokens to hijack accounts

**Component**: `/api/auth/reset-password` endpoint

**Attack Scenario**:
1. Victim requests password reset
2. System generates token using `timestamp + userId` pattern
3. Attacker requests their own reset to observe token format
4. Attacker enumerates tokens: `1672531200_1`, `1672531200_2`, etc.
5. Attacker uses guessed token to reset victim's password

**Impact**: Account takeover for any user. Attacker can lock out legitimate user and steal data.

**Likelihood**: Medium (requires understanding token format, but enumeration is fast)

**Mitigation**:
```typescript
// BAD: Predictable token
const resetToken = `${Date.now()}_${userId}`;

// GOOD: Cryptographically secure random token
import crypto from "crypto";

const resetToken = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString("hex"); // 256 bits
await db.saveResetToken({
  userId,
  token: await bcrypt.hash(resetToken, 12), // Hash before storing
  expires: Date.now() + 15 * 60 * 1000,     // 15-minute expiration
  used: false                                // One-time use
});
```

Additional controls:
- Rate limit reset requests (5 per hour per email)
- Send token only to registered email (never display in UI)
- Invalidate token after single use
- Log all reset attempts with IP/User-Agent for forensics
- Email user when password is changed (detection control)

**OWASP Mapping**: A07 - Authentication Failures, A04 - Insecure Design

## ‚úÖ Human Review Checklist

After AI generates spoofing threats, validate each finding before implementing mitigations. Here's what to verify:

<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1e293b 0%, #0f172a 100%); border-radius: 12px; padding: 28px; margin: 24px 0; border: 1px solid rgba(100, 116, 139, 0.3);">

### üîê Password and Credential Storage

The system should never store passwords in plaintext or use weak hashing algorithms like MD5 or SHA-1. All passwords must be hashed with bcrypt at cost factor 12 or higher, which takes approximately 250ms to compute and resists GPU cracking. Check that password policies enforce minimum complexity requirements: 12+ characters with mixed case, numbers, and symbols. Verify that credentials are never logged, transmitted in URLs, or exposed in error messages.

**Test it**: Attempt to log in with weak passwords like "password123" and verify they're rejected. Inspect database to confirm passwords are hashed.

---

### üé´ Token and Session Management

JWT secrets must be stored in environment variables and never hardcoded in source code or client bundles. The secrets should be cryptographically random with at least 256 bits of entropy. All tokens need expiration timestamps, typically 15 minutes for access tokens and 7 days for refresh tokens. Session cookies require `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Strict` flags to prevent XSS and CSRF attacks. Check that tokens are invalidated on logout and that refresh token rotation is implemented.

**Test it**: Inspect cookies in browser DevTools to verify security flags are set. Try replaying an expired token and confirm it's rejected.

---

### üîÑ Password Reset and Account Recovery

Password reset tokens must be generated using `crypto.randomBytes(32)` or equivalent, producing 256 bits of unpredictable randomness. The tokens should expire within 15-30 minutes and be single-use only (invalidated after consumption). Rate limiting must be enforced at 5 reset requests per hour per email address. The system should send email notifications whenever passwords are changed, allowing users to detect unauthorized resets.

**Test it**: Request multiple resets rapidly and verify rate limiting blocks excessive requests. Check that tokens expire and cannot be reused.

---

### üö™ Multi-Factor Authentication

For high-value accounts (admin, financial), multi-factor authentication should be mandatory, not optional. The system should support TOTP (time-based one-time passwords) via authenticator apps, SMS codes, or hardware keys. Backup codes must be generated at enrollment for account recovery. Verify that MFA cannot be bypassed through alternate authentication paths like password reset or "remember this device" shortcuts.

**Test it**: Attempt to log into admin account without MFA and verify access is denied. Try bypassing MFA through password reset flow.

---

### üîë API and Service Authentication

API keys should be 32+ characters of random data, stored hashed in the database, and rotated every 90 days. For service-to-service communication, use mutual TLS or OAuth client credentials flow instead of static API keys. Never embed API keys in mobile apps or client-side JavaScript where they can be extracted. Implement key scoping to limit what each API key can access.

**Test it**: Extract API key from mobile app binary and verify it has minimal permissions. Attempt to use key outside its intended scope.

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Brute Force and Account Lockout

Login endpoints must implement progressive delays or account lockout after 5 failed authentication attempts. Lockouts should last 15-30 minutes or require email verification to unlock. Add CAPTCHA after 3 failed attempts to block automated attacks. Monitor for distributed brute force attacks across multiple accounts and implement IP-based rate limiting.

**Test it**: Attempt to brute force a login with 10 incorrect passwords. Verify account locks and CAPTCHA appears.

---

### üìä Authentication Logging and Monitoring

All authentication events must be logged with timestamp, IP address, User-Agent, success/failure status, and user identifier. Logs should be sent to centralized logging system (ELK, Splunk, CloudWatch) for correlation. Alert on suspicious patterns: logins from new geolocations, multiple failed attempts, concurrent sessions from different IPs, or privilege escalation. Ensure PII like passwords is never logged.

**Validate**: Review authentication logs and verify they contain actionable forensic data. Test that password values are never present in any log.

---

### üî¨ Threat Scenario Realism

For each AI-generated threat, verify the attack scenario is technically feasible with current attacker capabilities. Check that the impact assessment is accurate ‚Äî does compromising this component truly lead to the claimed damage? Validate that mitigations are specific and implementable, not generic "use secure coding practices" advice. Ensure OWASP mappings are correct.

**Red flags**: Threats that require unrealistic attacker resources, mitigations that contradict business requirements, or scenarios that don't match your actual architecture.
