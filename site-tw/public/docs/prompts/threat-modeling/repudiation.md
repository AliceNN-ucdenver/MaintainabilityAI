# STRIDE: Repudiation â€” Threat Modeling Prompt Pack

> **Repudiation** is denying actions without proof to contradict the claim. This STRIDE category focuses on accountability failures where systems cannot prove who performed an action, when it occurred, or what changed.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What is Repudiation?

**Definition**: An attacker performs malicious actions and then denies having done so, with no audit trail to prove otherwise. Repudiation threatens **non-repudiation** â€” the ability to prove that a specific action was performed by a specific actor at a specific time.

**Common Repudiation Attack Vectors**:
- **Missing Audit Logs**: No record of who accessed or modified data
- **Log Tampering**: Attacker deletes or modifies logs to cover their tracks
- **Unauthenticated Actions**: Anonymous operations with no identity binding
- **Insufficient Detail**: Logs don't capture enough context (IP, user, timestamp)
- **Log Injection**: Attacker pollutes logs with fake entries

**Why It Matters**: Without comprehensive audit trails, you cannot detect insider threats, investigate security incidents, meet compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2), or prosecute attackers. Repudiation enables attackers to operate invisibly and deny responsibility when caught.

## ðŸ¤– AI Prompt: Identify Repudiation Threats in Architecture

<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1e293b 0%, #0f172a 100%); border-radius: 12px; padding: 24px; margin: 24px 0; border-left: 4px solid #10b981;">

**ðŸ“‹ Copy this prompt and paste it into ChatGPT, Claude, or GitHub Copilot Chat:**

```
Role: You are a security architect specializing in audit logging, compliance, and incident response. Your task is to perform STRIDE threat modeling focusing on Repudiation (R) threats.

Context:
I have the following architecture:

[PASTE YOUR ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM OR DESCRIPTION HERE]

Example:
- React SPA frontend with user dashboard
- Node.js REST API with Express
- PostgreSQL database storing user data
- Admin portal with elevated privileges
- Payment processing integration
- Email notification system
- No centralized logging (logs to local files)
- No log retention policy

Task:
Analyze this architecture for Repudiation threats. For each sensitive action, data modification, or privileged operation, identify where an attacker could perform actions without leaving a verifiable audit trail.

Format:
For each threat, provide:

**Threat**: [One-line description]
**Component**: [Which part of the system is vulnerable]
**Attack Scenario**: [Step-by-step attack walkthrough]
**Impact**: [What happens if successful â€” inability to detect breach, compliance failure, etc.]
**Likelihood**: [High/Medium/Low based on common attacker capabilities]
**Mitigation**: [Specific controls to prevent or detect this attack]
**OWASP Mapping**: [A09, A08, etc.]
**Code Example**: [Show vulnerable pattern and secure logging]

Focus Areas:
Pay special attention to:
- Authentication and authorization events (login, logout, password reset, privilege changes)
- Data access and modifications (SELECT with PII, UPDATE/DELETE operations)
- Administrative actions (user deletion, configuration changes, system settings)
- Financial transactions (payments, refunds, balance changes)
- Security-relevant events (failed auth attempts, suspicious patterns)
- Log storage and integrity (where logs are stored, who can access/modify them)
- Log retention and rotation policies
- Anonymous or unauthenticated actions

Output:
Provide 3-5 high-priority repudiation threats with complete details. Prioritize threats that impact incident response and compliance.
```

## ðŸ“‹ Example AI Output

### Threat 1: Missing Audit Logs for Admin User Deletion

**Threat**: Admin deletes user account with no audit trail of who or when

**Component**: `/api/admin/users/:id` DELETE endpoint

**Attack Scenario**:
1. Malicious admin (or attacker with stolen admin credentials) accesses admin portal
2. Admin deletes competitor's user account
3. No log entry is created recording the deletion
4. User complains their account is missing
5. Support team cannot determine who deleted the account or when
6. Admin denies involvement, no evidence to contradict

**Impact**: Inability to investigate insider threats, compliance violations (GDPR right to know who accessed data), damaged customer trust, potential legal liability.

**Likelihood**: High (insider threats are common, logging is often overlooked)

**Mitigation**:
```typescript
// BAD: No logging of deletion
app.delete("/api/admin/users/:id", isAdmin, async (req, res) => {
  await db.query("DELETE FROM users WHERE id = $1", [req.params.id]);
  res.json({ success: true });
});

// GOOD: Comprehensive audit logging
import winston from "winston";

const auditLogger = winston.createLogger({
  level: "info",
  format: winston.format.json(),
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.File({
      filename: "audit.log",
      options: { flags: "a" } // Append-only
    }),
    new winston.transports.Console() // Also log to centralized system
  ]
});

app.delete("/api/admin/users/:id", isAdmin, async (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;

  // Fetch user details before deletion
  const user = await db.query("SELECT username, email FROM users WHERE id = $1", [userId]);

  if (!user) {
    return res.status(404).json({ error: "User not found" });
  }

  // Delete user
  await db.query("DELETE FROM users WHERE id = $1", [userId]);

  // Log with comprehensive context
  auditLogger.info({
    event: "user_deleted",
    actor: {
      userId: req.user.id,
      username: req.user.username,
      role: req.user.role
    },
    target: {
      userId: user.id,
      username: user.username,
      email: user.email
    },
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    ip: req.ip,
    userAgent: req.get("User-Agent"),
    requestId: req.id // Trace to original request
  });

  res.json({ success: true });
});
```

Additional controls:
- Send logs to immutable storage (AWS CloudWatch, Splunk, ELK)
- Alert security team on sensitive actions (user deletion, privilege escalation)
- Require multi-person approval for destructive admin actions
- Maintain separate audit database that application cannot modify

---

### Threat 2: Log Tampering via Application Access

**Threat**: Attacker modifies or deletes logs to erase evidence of compromise

**Component**: Application logging to local file system (`/var/log/app.log`)

**Attack Scenario**:
1. Attacker compromises application server
2. Attacker performs malicious actions (data exfiltration, privilege escalation)
3. Logs are written to local file with read/write access for app user
4. Attacker deletes or modifies log entries showing their activity
5. Incident response team finds no evidence of breach
6. Attacker operates undetected

**Impact**: Inability to detect security incidents, corrupted forensic evidence, compliance violations, extended dwell time for attackers.

**Likelihood**: Medium (requires initial compromise, but log tampering is common)

**Mitigation**:
```typescript
// BAD: Logs stored locally where app can modify them
const logger = winston.createLogger({
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: "app.log" })
  ]
});

// GOOD: Logs sent to immutable external system
import { CloudWatchLogs } from "@aws-sdk/client-cloudwatch-logs";

const cloudwatch = new CloudWatchLogs({ region: "us-east-1" });

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.Console(),

    // Send to CloudWatch (immutable, append-only)
    new WinstonCloudWatch({
      logGroupName: "/app/production",
      logStreamName: `${process.env.HOSTNAME}-${Date.now()}`,
      awsAccessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY,
      awsSecretKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_KEY,
      awsRegion: "us-east-1"
    })
  ]
});

// Enable log integrity verification
logger.on("data", (info) => {
  // Generate HMAC signature for each log entry
  const signature = crypto.createHmac("sha256", process.env.LOG_SIGNING_KEY)
    .update(JSON.stringify(info))
    .digest("hex");

  info.signature = signature;
});
```

Additional controls:
- Use write-only log destinations (application cannot read or delete)
- Implement log signing with HMAC to detect tampering
- Set IAM policies preventing app from modifying CloudWatch logs
- Enable log file integrity monitoring (FIM) if using local files
- Require separate credentials for log access (not application credentials)

### Threat 3: Insufficient Context in Authentication Logs

**Threat**: Failed login attempts logged without IP or user context

**Component**: `/api/auth/login` endpoint

**Attack Scenario**:
1. Attacker attempts credential stuffing attack with 10,000 username/password pairs
2. System logs: `"Login failed"` (no username, IP, or timestamp)
3. Security team cannot identify attack pattern or block malicious IPs
4. Attacker eventually guesses valid credentials
5. Forensic investigation cannot determine how many accounts were compromised
6. Attacker denies targeting specific accounts

**Impact**: Inability to detect brute force attacks, cannot block malicious IPs, compliance violations (failed auth attempts are required for SOC 2, PCI DSS).

**Likelihood**: High (authentication is commonly targeted, logging details are often missed)

**Mitigation**:
```typescript
// BAD: Minimal logging with no context
app.post("/api/auth/login", async (req, res) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body;
  const user = await authenticateUser(username, password);

  if (!user) {
    logger.info("Login failed");
    return res.status(401).json({ error: "Invalid credentials" });
  }

  logger.info("Login successful");
  res.json({ token: generateToken(user) });
});

// GOOD: Comprehensive authentication logging
app.post("/api/auth/login", async (req, res) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body;

  const logContext = {
    username: username, // Safe to log username
    ip: req.ip,
    userAgent: req.get("User-Agent"),
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    requestId: req.id,
    geolocation: await geolocateIP(req.ip)
  };

  const user = await authenticateUser(username, password);

  if (!user) {
    logger.warn({
      event: "login_failed",
      reason: "invalid_credentials",
      ...logContext
    });

    // Increment failed attempt counter
    await rateLimiter.increment(`failed_login:${req.ip}`);

    return res.status(401).json({ error: "Invalid credentials" });
  }

  // Check for suspicious login patterns
  if (await isAnomalousLogin(user.id, req.ip)) {
    logger.warn({
      event: "anomalous_login",
      userId: user.id,
      reason: "new_location",
      ...logContext
    });

    // Send alert to user
    await sendSecurityAlert(user.email, logContext);
  }

  logger.info({
    event: "login_success",
    userId: user.id,
    ...logContext
  });

  res.json({ token: generateToken(user) });
});
```

Additional controls:
- Log both successful and failed authentication attempts
- Include IP, User-Agent, timestamp, geolocation in all auth logs
- Never log passwords (even hashed) or sensitive tokens
- Alert on suspicious patterns (new location, impossible travel time)
- Integrate with SIEM for correlation across systems
