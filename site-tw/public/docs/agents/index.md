### [Alice Agent - The Good Maintainer](/docs/agents/alice) üê∞
**Built on**: Claude Code
**Philosophy**: *"Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast."*
**Status**: Production-ready agentic AI proof of concept

**What is Alice?**

Alice is an autonomous security remediation agent that embodies the eight principles of excellent code maintainership: she reads documentation, tests cautiously, questions assumptions, maintains system integrity, documents her journey, believes in impossible things, manages chaos, and stays curious. Built on MaintainabilityAI's compact prompt packs, Alice automates security remediation while keeping humans firmly in control.

**The Eight Principles**:
1. üìñ **Read the documentation** (prompts, labels, context)
2. üß™ **Test cautiously** (incremental, validated changes)
3. ü§î **Question assumptions** (challenge technical debt)
4. üéØ **Maintain identity** (system integrity through transformations)
5. üìù **Document the journey** (detailed commits, rationale)
6. üåü **Believe in impossible things** (legacy code CAN be fixed)
7. üé™ **Manage chaos** (bring order to complex codebases)
8. üîç **Stay curious** (explore before acting)

**Strengths**:
- üõ°Ô∏è **Security-First**: SHA-256 hash verification, domain allowlisting, structured logging
- üîÑ **Two-Phase Workflow**: Curiosity (read-only analysis) ‚Üí Human Approval ‚Üí Implementation
- üìö **Guided by Wisdom**: Uses OWASP/STRIDE/Maintainability compact prompt packs (23 files)
- üß™ **Incremental Change**: Tests after each step, never massive refactors
- üë§ **Human-in-the-Loop**: Proposes plans, humans approve and merge PRs

**Use Cases** (Alice thrives on "impossible" problems):
- Security vulnerabilities everyone accepted as "too hard to fix"
- Legacy code with 1000-line functions and zero tests
- Technical debt from "temporary" fixes that became permanent
- Code complexity that makes onboarding painful
- Systematic OWASP remediation with CI/CD integration

**Quick Start**:
1. Comment `@alice analyze this` on any CodeQL issue
2. Alice reads the "Drink Me" label (OWASP/STRIDE prompt pack)
3. Alice explores your codebase and creates a remediation plan
4. You review and approve: `@alice approved`
5. Alice implements, tests, and creates PR
6. You review code and merge when satisfied

**Agentic AI Proof of Concept**: Alice demonstrates how autonomous AI agents can accelerate security remediation while maintaining strict governance through two-phase workflows, hash verification, and human approval gates. See the full workflow implementation in [`examples/agents/`](https://github.com/maintainabilityai/maintainabilityai/tree/main/examples/agents).

### [Multi-Agent Orchestration](/docs/agents/multi-agent)
**Best For**: Complex workflows requiring specialized expertise

**Patterns**:
- **Sequential Pipeline**: Threat Model ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Review
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents working on independent modules
- **Validator Loop**: One agent generates, another validates
- **Consensus Validation**: Multiple agents review and approve

**Key Workflow**: Threat Modeler (ChatGPT) ‚Üí Architect (Claude) ‚Üí Implementer (Copilot) ‚Üí Validator (Claude) ‚Üí Reviewer (ChatGPT)

**Quick Start**: [Multi-Agent Guide](/docs/agents/multi-agent)

## Choosing the Right Agent

### By Development Phase

| SDLC Phase | Primary Agent | Supporting Agents | Output |

| **Implementation** | Copilot (Code Gen) | Claude (Refactoring), Alice (Remediation) | Secure implementation |
| **Verification** | Claude (Test Gen) | CodeQL, Snyk, Alice (Auto-fix) | Test suite + scan results |
| **Governance** | ChatGPT (Review) | Human | Approval decision |
| **Deployment** | GitHub Actions | Alice (CI/CD Remediation) | Production deployment |

- **Alternative**: Claude (more thorough)

**Medium Complexity** (2-3 files, security constraints):
- **First Choice**: Claude (multi-file coordination)
- **Alternative**: ChatGPT + Copilot (design then implement)

**High Complexity** (5+ files, architectural changes):
- **Recommended**: Multi-agent workflow
  1. ChatGPT: Threat model and architecture
  2. Claude: Implementation and testing
  3. ChatGPT: Final security review

## Universal Best Practices

### 1. Always Reference OWASP Prompt Packs

```markdown
Reference the A01 Broken Access Control prompt pack at /docs/prompts/owasp/A01_broken_access_control

Apply this to my code:
[your specific context]
```

**All agents** benefit from explicit security requirements.

### 2. Provide Complete Context

```markdown
Context:
- Tech stack: Node 18 + TypeScript + Express + PostgreSQL
- OWASP categories: A01, A03, A07
- Constraints: Complexity ‚â§10, Coverage ‚â•80%
- Files: [list]

Task: [specific task]
```

### 3. Request Tests Alongside Implementation

```markdown
Generate:
1. Secure implementation
2. Comprehensive tests (positive + attack vectors)
3. Fitness function checks
```

### 4. Verify with Automated Tools

After AI generation:
- Run ESLint security rules
- Execute Jest tests (including attack vectors)
- Run CodeQL or Snyk scan
- Check complexity with fitness functions

### 5. Document AI Decisions

```typescript
/**
 * SECURITY: OWASP A03 - Injection Prevention
 * Uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
 * AI-assisted implementation with Claude
 */
```

## Integration with Framework

### Prompt Pack Structure

All agents work with the same prompt pack format:

```markdown
Role: [Security Engineer, Architect, etc.]

Context:
- Tech stack: [specific versions]
- Security level: [Production/Development]
- Compliance: [OWASP, PCI-DSS, etc.]

Requirements:
- [Specific security controls]

Task:
- [Explicit implementation steps]

Checklist:
- ‚òê [Verification item 1]
- ‚òê [Verification item 2]

Success Criteria:
- [How to verify it works]
```

### SDLC Integration

Each agent integrates at specific SDLC phases:

1. **Phase 1 - Design**: ChatGPT for threat modeling
2. **Phase 2 - Implementation**: Copilot/Claude for secure coding
3. **Phase 3 - Verification**: Claude for test generation
4. **Phase 4 - Governance**: ChatGPT for compliance review
5. **Phase 5 - Deployment**: Automated tools (CodeQL, Snyk)
6. **Phase 6 - Evolution**: Claude for refactoring, ChatGPT for analysis

See [SDLC Framework](/docs/sdlc/) for details.
