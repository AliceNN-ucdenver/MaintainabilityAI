## Human Review Process

### Step 1: Automated PR Checks

GitHub Actions runs automatically on PR open:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/pr-checks.yml
name: PR Security Checks

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  security-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: ESLint
        run: npm run lint

      - name: Jest Tests
        run: npm test -- --coverage

      - name: CodeQL Analysis
        uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v3

      - name: Snyk Security Scan
        uses: snyk/actions/node@master
        env:
          SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}

      - name: Fitness Functions
        run: node scripts/fitness-functions.js

      - name: PR Template Check
        run: |
          if ! grep -q "AI Assistance Disclosure" PR_BODY.md; then
            echo "❌ PR must include AI disclosure section"
            exit 1
          fi
```

All checks must pass before human review begins.

### Step 2: Golden Rules Validation

Reviewer applies each of the 6 Golden Rules:

**Rule 1: Be Specific About Intent and Constraints**
```markdown
Review Question: Were the prompts specific?

Check:
- [ ] OWASP prompt packs referenced in commits
- [ ] Tech stack constraints specified
- [ ] Security requirements explicit
- [ ] Task broken into clear steps

Evidence: Check commit messages for prompt references.
```

**Rule 2: Trust But Verify**
```markdown
Review Question: Does the reviewer understand the code?

Check:
- [ ] Review each function for security logic
- [ ] Verify all OWASP controls are correctly implemented
- [ ] Test with attack payloads (manually or via tests)
- [ ] No "magic" code that isn't explained

Red Flags:
❌ Hardcoded secrets
❌ Missing input validation
❌ Generic try/catch without error handling
❌ Disabled security checks
```

**Rule 3: Treat AI Like a Junior Dev**
```markdown
Review Question: Is the code quality appropriate?

Check:
- [ ] Code follows team patterns and style
- [ ] No over-engineering or unnecessary complexity
- [ ] Security controls are not "clever" (simple > clever)
- [ ] Tests are comprehensive (not just happy path)

Ask: Would I approve this from a junior developer?
```

**Rule 4: Isolate AI Changes**
```markdown
Review Question: Are AI-generated changes clearly labeled?

Check:
- [ ] Commits have 🤖 AI-assisted label
- [ ] AI tool identified (Copilot/Claude/ChatGPT)
- [ ] Prompt pack referenced
- [ ] PR has AI disclosure section

Evidence: Search commit messages for "AI-assisted"
```

**Rule 5: Document Rationale**
```markdown
Review Question: Are security decisions documented?

Check:
- [ ] Inline comments explain "why" not just "what"
- [ ] OWASP categories referenced in code
- [ ] Threat IDs from Phase 1 linked to controls
- [ ] ADRs created for significant decisions

Example:
// SECURITY: OWASP A01 - Why we check ownership here
// Threat: T6 (IDOR attack via share enumeration)
// Mitigation: Verify requester owns document before allowing share
```

**Rule 6: Share Winning Prompts**
```markdown
Review Question: Should this prompt be added to team library?

Check:
- [ ] Prompt produced secure code on first try?
- [ ] Reusable pattern for future features?
- [ ] Added to `/prompts/team/` directory?

Action: If yes, create prompt pack in team library
```

---

### Step 3: OWASP Compliance Review

Use **ChatGPT** to validate OWASP compliance:

```markdown
Role: Security Code Reviewer

Context:
- PR implements document sharing feature
- Claims to address OWASP A01, A03, A09
- Code: [paste implementation]

Task: Review code against OWASP checklists.

For each category:

## A01: Broken Access Control
Checklist:
□ Deny-by-default access control
□ Ownership verification before operations
□ No IDOR vulnerabilities (non-sequential IDs)
□ Authorization failures logged
□ No client-side access control bypass

Finding: [PASS/FAIL with explanation]

## A03: Injection
Checklist:
□ Parameterized queries only (no string concat)
□ Input validation with Zod/schema validation
□ Character allowlists for text inputs
□ Length limits enforced
□ Output encoding if rendered

Finding: [PASS/FAIL with explanation]

## A09: Logging/Monitoring
Checklist:
□ Security events logged (auth failures, injection attempts)
□ PII redacted from logs
□ Logs immutable and tamper-evident
□ Log correlation IDs for tracing

Finding: [PASS/FAIL with explanation]

Overall Recommendation: APPROVE / REQUEST CHANGES
```

### Step 4: Security Threat Coverage

Verify every threat from Phase 1 is mitigated:

```markdown
Threat Coverage Matrix:

| Threat | Mitigation | Code Location | Test Coverage | Status |
|--------|------------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| T1: JWT forgery | JWT signature validation | `auth.middleware.ts:12` | `auth.test.ts:45` | ✅ Pass |
| T3: Permission escalation | Immutable permissions | `createShare.ts:28` | `createShare.test.ts:67` | ✅ Pass |
| T4: SQL injection | Parameterized queries + Zod | `createShare.ts:34` | `createShare.test.ts:89` | ✅ Pass |
| T5: No audit trail | Audit logging | `createShare.ts:42` | `createShare.test.ts:110` | ✅ Pass |
| T6: IDOR | UUID IDs + authz check | `createShare.ts:18` | `createShare.test.ts:55` | ✅ Pass |
| T7: Info disclosure | Generic errors | `errors.ts:15` | `createShare.test.ts:78` | ✅ Pass |
| T8: DoS | Rate limiting | `routes.ts:8` | `routes.test.ts:23` | ✅ Pass |
| T9: Re-sharing | Owner-only check | `createShare.ts:22` | `createShare.test.ts:62` | ✅ Pass |

Result: 8/8 threats mitigated ✅
```

---

### Step 5: Manual Security Testing

Perform exploratory security testing:

```markdown
Manual Test Plan:

1. **IDOR Attack**:
   - Create share as User A for doc-123
   - Try to access share as User B (should fail)
   - Try to modify share as User B (should fail)

2. **SQL Injection**:
   - Submit email: `'; DROP TABLE users--`
   - Verify: 400 error, validation message, no database change

3. **Permission Escalation**:
   - Create share with 'read' permission
   - Try to update to 'admin' as recipient
   - Verify: 403 error, permission unchanged

4. **Audit Trail**:
   - Create share
   - Check audit_log table for entry
   - Verify: timestamp, user_id, action correct

5. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Create 61 shares in 1 minute
   - Verify: 429 error on request 61
   - Verify: Rate limit logged

Result: All manual tests passed ✅
```
