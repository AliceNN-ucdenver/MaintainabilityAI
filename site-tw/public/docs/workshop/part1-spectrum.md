## The Three Modes

### 1. Vibe Coding

**Characteristics:**
- Rapid, exploratory coding with minimal upfront planning
- "Prompt-first" approach: write a prompt, accept the code, iterate
- Minimal code review or validation
- Focus on speed and experimentation

**Best For:**
- Quick prototypes and proof-of-concepts
- "Throwaway weekend projects"
- Learning new frameworks or languages
- Rapid experimentation with new ideas

**Risks:**
- Creates fragile, "house of cards" code
- Lacks security considerations
- Technical debt accumulates quickly
- Difficult to maintain or extend
- No quality gates or validation

**Example:**
```markdown
Prompt: "Build me a REST API for a todo app with user authentication"
Result: AI generates code, you run it, it works... for now.
```

---

### 2. AI-Assisted Engineering

**Characteristics:**
- "Plan-first" methodology with human architecture
- Developer remains in control as "architect and editor"
- AI treated as a "pair programmer" handling routine tasks
- Maintains software quality and engineering standards
- Integrates security gates and validation

**Best For:**
- Production systems requiring maintainability
- Teams with security and compliance requirements
- Codebases that need long-term support
- Complex systems requiring domain expertise

**Process:**
1. Human defines architecture and constraints
2. AI generates implementation within guardrails
3. Developer reviews, tests, and validates
4. Code passes through quality gates (ESLint, Jest, CodeQL)
5. Human approval before merge

**Example:**
```markdown
Prompt: "You are a security engineer implementing OWASP A03:2021 - Injection.

Context: Node 18 + TypeScript + PostgreSQL
Requirements:
- Use parameterized queries only
- Validate inputs with Zod
- Generic error messages

Task: Refactor examples/owasp/A03_injection/insecure.ts
Security Checklist: [...]"
```

---

### 3. Autonomous Agentic Coding

**Characteristics:**
- Delegation of entire tasks to AI agents
- "Plan-execute-verify-report" workflow
- Agent operates independently in sandbox environment
- Multi-step reasoning and tool usage
- Human reviews final deliverable

**Best For:**
- Well-defined, scoped refactoring tasks
- Repetitive migrations across many files
- Documentation generation
- Test case generation
- Code modernization (e.g., upgrade to new framework version)

**Process:**
1. Human defines task and acceptance criteria
2. Agent creates implementation plan
3. Agent executes plan with multiple steps
4. Agent runs validation and tests
5. Agent reports results
6. Human reviews and approves

**Example:**
```markdown
Task: "Migrate all 50 React class components to functional components with hooks.
Ensure all PropTypes are converted to TypeScript interfaces.
Run tests after each file. Report any failures."
```

---

## The 70% Problem

AI excels at generating the initial **70%** of code:
- Boilerplate and scaffolding
- Standard CRUD operations
- Routine data transformations
- Common patterns and algorithms
- Repetitive tasks

The final **30%** requires human expertise:
- System design and architecture decisions
- Complex debugging and root cause analysis
- Domain-specific knowledge and business rules
- Security threat modeling
- Performance optimization
- Cross-functional communication
- Critical thinking and foresight

**Key Insight**: The rise of AI transforms developers into **"AI Code Hardeners"** who specialize in transforming AI-generated drafts into robust, production-ready software.

---

## Where Humans Add Value

### 1. System Design

- **AI Limitation**: Lacks holistic view of system architecture
- **Human Value**: Understand trade-offs, scalability needs, integration points

**Example**: AI can implement a caching layer, but humans decide:
- Which caching strategy fits the access pattern?
- Where to place cache invalidation?
- How to handle cache stampede scenarios?

### 2. Debugging Complex Issues

- **AI Limitation**: Struggles with race conditions, memory leaks, edge cases
- **Human Value**: Pattern recognition from experience, domain knowledge, debugging intuition

**Example**: Production bug where payments fail intermittently
- AI might suggest checking logs or adding retry logic
- Human recognizes it's a clock skew issue causing signature validation failures

### 3. Domain Expertise

- **AI Limitation**: No understanding of business context or industry regulations
- **Human Value**: HIPAA compliance, financial regulations, domain-specific security requirements

**Example**: Healthcare application
- AI generates user authentication
- Human ensures HIPAA-compliant audit logging, patient consent workflows, PHI encryption

### 4. Security Threat Modeling

- **AI Limitation**: Can follow security patterns but doesn't anticipate novel attack vectors
- **Human Value**: Adversarial thinking, understanding attacker motivations, risk assessment

**Example**: OAuth integration
- AI implements standard OAuth flow
- Human identifies: What if the redirect_uri is manipulated? How do we prevent token replay?

### 5. Performance Optimization

- **AI Limitation**: May not understand real-world performance constraints
- **Human Value**: Profiling, benchmarking, understanding hardware limitations

**Example**: Database query optimization
- AI suggests adding indexes
- Human analyzes query patterns, cardinality, and decides to denormalize data

---

## Real Examples from This Repository

### Example 1: A03 Injection Remediation

**AI-Generated (70%)**:
```typescript
// AI creates parameterized query structure
const sql = 'SELECT id, email FROM users WHERE email ILIKE $1';
const res = await client.query(sql, [query]);
```

**Human Hardening (30%)**:
- Add Zod validation with domain-specific allowlist
- Define appropriate length limits based on database schema
- Implement logging for blocked injection attempts
- Add rate limiting to prevent brute force
- Write comprehensive test cases including edge cases

### Example 2: A01 Broken Access Control

**AI-Generated (70%)**:
```typescript
// AI creates RBAC middleware
function requireRole(role: string) {
  return (req, res, next) => {
    if (req.user.role === role) next();
    else res.status(403).send('Forbidden');
  };
}
```

**Human Hardening (30%)**:
- Identify that role comparison is too simple (what about hierarchies?)
- Add deny-by-default logic
- Implement horizontal access control (user can only access their own data)
- Add audit logging for access control failures
- Consider context: time-based access, IP restrictions, MFA requirements

### Example 3: Security Pipeline Design

**AI Cannot Do**: Design the multi-layered security pipeline shown in this repo's README

**Human Architecture**:
1. IDE layer with security-first prompts
2. Local checks (ESLint, Jest)
3. Pre-commit hooks (Snyk Code)
4. CI/CD gates (CodeQL, Snyk)
5. Human review with PR template
6. Post-deploy monitoring

This architecture requires:
- Understanding organizational risk tolerance
- Knowing which tools complement vs. overlap
- Deciding which failures should block vs. warn
- Balancing security with developer velocity

## Choosing the Right Mode

| Factor | Vibe Coding | AI-Assisted | Agentic |
|--------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Security Criticality** | Low | High | Medium |
| **Code Lifespan** | Hours/Days | Months/Years | Varies |
| **Team Size** | Individual | Team | Team |
| **Compliance Needs** | None | High | Medium |
| **Domain Complexity** | Low | High | Medium |
| **Maintenance Burden** | None | High | Medium |

**Recommendation for Security-Critical Systems**: Use **AI-Assisted Engineering** mode with:
- Security-first prompt packs (like OWASP A01-A10 in this repo)
- Multi-layered validation (local + CI/CD)
- Human review with security checklist
- Clear AI disclosure in commits/PRs

---

## What Happens When You Choose the Wrong Mode?

### Failure Mode 1: Vibe Coding in Production

**Scenario**: Developer uses Vibe mode to "quickly" implement user authentication, ships to production without review.

**What Goes Wrong**:
```typescript
// Vibe-coded authentication (looks fine, but...)
app.post('/login', async (req, res) => {
  const { email, password } = req.body;
  const user = await db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE email='${email}'`);
  if (user && user.password === password) {
    res.json({ token: jwt.sign({ id: user.id }, 'secret123') });
  }
});
```

**Security Failures:**
- ❌ **SQL Injection (A03)**: String concatenation with user input
- ❌ **Broken Authentication (A07)**: Plain text password comparison
- ❌ **Cryptographic Failure (A02)**: Hardcoded JWT secret
- ❌ **No Input Validation**: Missing rate limiting, email format checks
- ❌ **No Logging**: Can't detect brute force attacks

**Real-World Impact:**
- Production breach within 48 hours
- All user credentials compromised
- Regulatory fine (GDPR: up to €20M)
- Reputational damage

**Cost:** 6 months of security remediation vs. 2 hours of proper AI-Assisted implementation

---

### Failure Mode 2: Agentic Coding Without Verification

**Scenario**: Developer assigns agent to "refactor the payment processing module," deploys without testing.

**What Goes Wrong**:
```typescript
// Agent refactored for "better readability"
async function processPayment(order: Order) {
  const amount = order.total;
  await chargeCard(order.cardToken, amount);
  await db.updateOrder(order.id, { status: 'paid' });
  await sendConfirmationEmail(order.email);
}
```

**Silent Bugs Introduced:**
- ❌ **Race Condition**: No transaction wrapper (card charged but DB update fails)
- ❌ **Double Charging**: No idempotency key (retry charges card twice)
- ❌ **Error Handling**: Exception in email sends crashes entire function
- ❌ **Missing Audit**: No logging of payment events
- ❌ **Currency Precision**: Floats can cause rounding errors (should use integer cents)

**Real-World Impact:**
- Customers charged multiple times
- Lost revenue (some orders marked paid without charging)
- Payment processor penalties
- Customer support overload

**Cost:** 3 weeks of incident response + refunds vs. 30 minutes of code review

---

### Failure Mode 3: AI-Assisted Without Human Domain Expertise

**Scenario**: Developer uses security-first prompt to implement medical record access control, but doesn't understand HIPAA requirements.

**What Goes Wrong**:
```typescript
// AI-generated RBAC (technically secure, but...)
function canAccessRecord(user: User, record: MedicalRecord): boolean {
  if (user.role === 'doctor') return true;
  if (user.role === 'nurse' && record.wardId === user.wardId) return true;
  return false;
}
```

**Compliance Failures:**
- ❌ **HIPAA Minimum Necessary**: Doctors shouldn't access ALL records, only their patients
- ❌ **Break-Glass Missing**: No emergency access override for life-threatening situations
- ❌ **Audit Trail**: No logging of who accessed which records (HIPAA requirement)
- ❌ **Patient Consent**: No checking if patient authorized access
- ❌ **Time-Based Access**: Former employees still have access (no revocation)

**Real-World Impact:**
- HIPAA violation: $100K - $50M fine per incident
- Loss of hospital accreditation
- Criminal charges for privacy breach

**Cost:** Hospital shutdown for compliance audit vs. 1 day of HIPAA training before implementation

---

### Failure Mode 4: Wrong Tool for Wrong Task

**Scenario**: Using Agentic mode for system architecture design.

**What AI Generates**:
```
"Use microservices architecture with Kafka for event streaming,
deploy on Kubernetes with Istio service mesh, Redis for caching,
PostgreSQL for primary storage, MongoDB for audit logs..."
```

**Why This Fails:**
- ❌ **Over-Engineering**: Your startup has 3 users, doesn't need distributed system
- ❌ **No Context**: AI doesn't know your team size (2 developers), budget ($500/mo), or timeline (2 weeks)
- ❌ **Operational Complexity**: Team doesn't have Kubernetes expertise
- ❌ **Premature Optimization**: Adds 6 months of infrastructure work for zero business value

**Correct Approach**: Human architect makes decision (monolith + SQLite for MVP), uses AI-Assisted for implementation.

---

### How to Avoid These Failures

| Failure Mode | Prevention | Cost of Prevention | Cost of Failure |
|--------------|------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Vibe in Production | Use AI-Assisted for anything beyond throwaway demos | +2 hours | 6 months remediation |
| Agentic Without Verification | Mandatory code review + test suite before merge | +30 minutes | 3 weeks incident response |
| Missing Domain Expertise | Human defines requirements, AI implements | +1 day training | $50M HIPAA fine |
| Wrong Tool for Wrong Task | Human makes architecture decisions | +2 hours design doc | 6 months wasted engineering |

**Golden Rule**: The cost of prevention is always 100x cheaper than the cost of failure.

---

## Workshop Exercise

**Scenario**: You need to implement user authentication for a new microservice.

**Questions**:
1. Which mode would you choose and why?
2. What security constraints would you include in your prompt?
3. What human validation would you perform after AI generates code?
4. How would you document this for your team?

**Discussion Points**:
- How does your answer change if it's a prototype vs. production system?
- What if you're unfamiliar with the authentication library?
- What if there are regulatory compliance requirements (HIPAA, PCI-DSS)?

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Vibe Coding is not inherently bad** - it's appropriate for experimentation and learning
2. **AI-Assisted Engineering is the gold standard** for production systems requiring security and maintainability
3. **Agentic Coding is powerful** for well-defined, scoped tasks but requires careful task framing
4. **The 70% problem is real** - AI excels at scaffolding, humans excel at hardening
5. **Security requires human judgment** - threat modeling, risk assessment, and domain expertise cannot be fully automated
6. **Your role is evolving** from "code writer" to "AI code hardener" and "system architect"
